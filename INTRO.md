# Python Plotting for Exploratory Analysis

> "The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's
mind than any other device." â€” John Tukey

Plotting is an essential component of data analysis. As a data scientist,
I spend a significant amount of my time making simple plots to understand complex data sets (exploratory data analysis) and help others understand them (presentations).

Before I started using Python

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/ "Matplotlib: Python plotting"): "Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms."
* [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ "plotnine: A grammar of graphics for Python"): "plotnine is an implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python, it is based on ggplot2."
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/ "Seaborn: statistical data visualization"): "Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics."
* [Pandas plots](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html "pandas documentation"): "basics to easily create decent looking plots" from data frames using on Matplotlib under the hood.
* [ggpy](https://github.com/yhat/ggpy "ggplot port for python"): A "ggplot port for Python" that isn't under active development.
* [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/ "Declarative Visualization in Python"): "Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega-Lite."
* [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/ "Python interactive visualization library"): "Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation."

I remain a big fan of Hadley Wickham's [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/ "ggplot2"), a "[grammar of graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448 "The Grammar of Graphics (Statistics and Computing): Leland Wilkinson, D. Wills, D. Rope, A. Norton, R. Dubbs: 9780387245447: Amazon.com: Books")" implementation in R.
